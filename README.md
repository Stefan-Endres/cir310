Phase equilibrium project 
---
In this project you will apply your knowledge of chemical thermodynamics developed during the course on practical engineering problems. The project is divided into three parts. Part 1 will test your qualitative reasoning abilities of chemical phase equilibria on the problem. In Part 2 you will perform some analytical and symbolic calculations on phase equilibrium models. Finally in Part 3 you will improve the accuracy of the simulation by writing your own code which uses more advanced thermodynamic models. You may use any internet resources or software packages to complete the project. 

The pdf file [Project Part 1 Handout.pdf](https://github.com/Stefan-Endres/cir310/blob/master/Project Part 1 Handout.pdf) contains the question for Part 1 of the project to be completed by March 22.
